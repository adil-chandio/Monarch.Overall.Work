# Film editing — incomplete workprints

The 796.042-second narration has **not** been turned into a complete film. This folder builds four candidate editorial sections and tracks coverage without labelling missing footage as finished. The sources are existing native-3D development footage; no previously rejected slide/recut video is used. The shots remain provisional and are **not** a substitute for the storyboard's missing narrative action. The opening repeats two visual sources, lacks several requested physical actions, and ends mid-story. The same 3D mammoth model appears repeatedly. The hypothesis and genomic-gap inserts are conceptual work, not observation. Caption timing, visual continuity and science are not reviewed. They need substantial animation and edit work.

`opening-cut.json` describes a first-pass 0–85s picture edit with exact frame counts and hash-pinned source render files. `build_opening.py` makes an unapproved 85s A/V workprint using the prior unreviewed narration/score. `build_insert.py` builds three separate inserts at provisional 172.733s (2017 genome comparison), 370s (rain-on-snow hypothesis) and 629.0667s (2024 genomic gap). All output is ignored in `.cache/mammoth-edit/`; it is not a deliverable. The map depicts modern shorelines only; the dig is illustrative and not a Wrangel site. The ice sequence is hypothetical, and the gap is explicitly a gap in the 2024 genetic sample set, not in all evidence. No voice sync has been manually reviewed. No scene-specific SFX are included in these edits.

The scripts require the exact hash-pinned prior rendered clips in the ignored cache, Python `imageio-ffmpeg` and the soundtrack. Some of those files are local and need rerendering from their respective scene directories. The living-world opening shot specifically requires `MAMMOTH_REVIEW_CACHE="$PWD/.cache/living-world-edit" node production/extinct-life/longform-mammoth/cinematic-rebuild/living-world/render-preview.mjs 690`. Hardware/software differences can change rendered hashes, requiring an intentional editorial check and plan update rather than silent replacement. Map/gap renders are produced with their respective `render-preview.mjs`. Run from repository root:

```

Builds perform full FFmpeg decode, frame count, peak and source-hash checks, but **not** continuous listening, audiovisual sign-off, science accuracy, rights clearance or assessment of storytelling quality. `check_coverage.py` counts a segment only if its QC matches the actual cache file. A complete duration is not equivalent to a finished film, and a partial duration must not be distributed as the completed documentary. See each scene's README and the soundtrack/music/asset READMEs for sources, rights uncertainties and required credits. Nothing authorizes YouTube publication.
